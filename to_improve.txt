The project seems well-structured for a basic hotel management system. Here are some potential improvements, focusing on code quality, features, and user experience:

Code Quality & Best Practices:

Use Django's built-in permissions and authentication: Instead of custom Guest model, leverage Django's User model more fully for guests. Extend it with a UserProfile if needed for extra guest details. This simplifies authentication and authorization logic.
Implement proper form validation: Enhance form validation in forms.py and views to provide more user-friendly error messages and handle edge cases. For example, in BookingForm, validate date ranges, room availability, etc.
Add unit tests: The project lacks tests (hotel_management/hotel_app/tests.py is empty). Writing unit tests for models, views, and forms will improve code reliability and make future changes safer.
Consider using class-based views for booking views: Convert function-based views like booking_form and booking_confirmation to class-based views for better organization and reusability.
Implement API documentation: For the REST API, consider adding documentation using tools like Swagger or drf-spectacular. This makes the API easier to use and understand for developers.
Use environment variables for sensitive settings: Store sensitive information like database credentials and API keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in settings.py.
Features:

Room Management Features:
Room Images: Add images to the Room model and display them in room lists and detail views.
Room Amenities: Add a model for room amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, breakfast) and link them to rooms.
Admin Room Management: Improve the admin interface for managing rooms, including bulk actions, filtering, and searching.
Booking Management Features:
Booking Cancellation: Implement booking cancellation functionality with appropriate logic and notifications.
Booking Modification: Allow users to modify bookings (dates, guests, etc.) with validation and restrictions.
Booking History: Display booking history for logged-in users.
Admin Booking Management: Enhance admin interface for managing bookings, including filtering, searching, and status updates (e.g., confirmed, checked-in, checked-out).
Payment Features:
Integrate with a real payment gateway: Instead of just recording payment information, integrate with a payment gateway (like Stripe or PayPal) to process payments online.
Payment History: Display payment history for bookings.
User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):
Improve styling: Enhance the UI with better CSS styling to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
Responsive Design: Ensure the website is responsive and works well on different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices).
User-friendly booking process: Streamline the booking process to make it more intuitive and efficient.
Search and filtering for rooms: Implement search and filtering options on the room list page to help users find rooms based on criteria like price, capacity, room type, and amenities.
Specific File Improvements:

hotel_app/models.py:
Consider adding indexes to frequently queried fields like Room.number and Booking.check_in for performance.
Add more choices for Room.room_type and Staff.role to make them more descriptive and maintainable.
hotel_app/forms.py:
Implement custom validation logic in BookingForm to prevent overlapping bookings and enforce business rules.
hotel_app/views.py:
Refactor function-based views to class-based views where appropriate.
Add more detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.
hotel_app/templates/:
Improve template structure and organization.
Use template inheritance effectively to reduce code duplication.
Enhance UI elements and styling.
